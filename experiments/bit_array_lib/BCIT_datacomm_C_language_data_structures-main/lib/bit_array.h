/**
 * Dynamic array of bits. Size is bit_length when bit_array is initialized.
 * The bits are added left to right.
 *
 * Example: you create bit_array with minimum capacity of 16 bits
 * and then add 4 individual bits: 1 -> 1 -> 0 -> 1 to the array.
 * Your data will be stored like so: [1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0] [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
 *
 * Note: bit_length is separate from bit_capacity meaning that after
 * you initialize the array, you still need to add the bits before
 * setting or checking them. An advantage of this is that the
 * array is able to track it's own length exactly to the bit, rather
 * than in chunks of 8.
